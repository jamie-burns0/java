Code fragments and exercises for preparation to sit Java 17 certification exam.

Quick background. Functioning in tech lead, team lead, business and product owner roles took me away from hands-on coding. Returning to hands-on coding, I found myself 10 versions behind the then Java LTS. I also bought a copy of the __OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-829__ by Selidoff and Boyarsky - https://amzn.asia/d/jl3pWas. This repository are my little code exercises and fragments as i worked throught the study guide.
